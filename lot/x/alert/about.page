All method names except `get`, `let`, and `set` can be used. This class makes use of the `__callStatic()` method to generate dynamic types. Each method declares the alert type. The most common and recommended method names are `error`, `info`, and `success`, which can be used to represent [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic) (`error` as `false`, `info` as `null`, and `success` as `true`).

~~~ .php
Alert::error('This is an error message.');
Alert::info('This is an info message.');
Alert::success('This is a success message.');
~~~

To display the alert block in your layout, add this line at a specific point in your layout file, for example under the form’s opening tag:

~~~ .php
<?= self::alert(); ?>
~~~

The built-in alert block doesn’t care about the type. Every alert created will be passed as a `<p role="alert">…</p>` element in the HTML output. To generate unique alert block for each type, you need to make your own HTML output in a `.\lot\layout\alert.php` file:

~~~ .php
<?php foreach (alert() as $v): ?>
  <p class="alert alert-<?= $v[2]['type']; ?>" role="alert">
    <?= $v[1]; ?>
  </p>
<?php endforeach; ?>
